# Introduction to Robotics - Laboratory Homework

This folder will be updated (in time, I hope) with each homework/project for the laboratory.

### Homework 1: RGB Analog Control

Control an RGB LED using a potentiometer for each main color (reading the analog input from the potentiometer and using it to control the output: the intensity of each color).

### Homework 2: Knock Detector Buzzer

Make a buzzer emit sound when the value read by another piezo buzzer is higher than a specified threshold. The buzzer must stop once a button is pressed.

### Homework 3: Joystick Controlled 4-7-Segment Display

Control a 4-7-Segment Display using a joystick. The X axis cycles through the digits; the Y axis is used to modify the digit; the button is used to switch between states.
